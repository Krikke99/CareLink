## Description

Repo for CareLink Windows App
This is a Visual Basic application that provides a UI to view Medtronic 670G and 770G and 780G.

This shows all available data and is not in any way supported by Medtronic, it was created from publicly available data.
Some data was filtered out because I could not see any use for it. You can turn off filters but performance will suffer.

For the visualization layer I use the open source
System.Windows.Forms.DataVisualization
https://GitHub.com/Kirsan31/WinForms-DataVisualization

#Known Issue
- If you get a 
> "System.Configuration.ConfigurationErrorsException: 'Configuration system failed to initialize'"
